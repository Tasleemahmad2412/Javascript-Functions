//this is the prop of Js that it has first class functions which enables us to write higher order functions
//Js treats functions as first-class citizens
//means functions are simply values
//functions are just another type of object

//since functions are values thats why we can do some things like storing the in variables or object properties
//we can also return a function from another function

//there are laso function methods in js like the bind methos is an example of that

// -------------------- HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS --------------------
// a function that receives another function as an argument or returns a function or both
